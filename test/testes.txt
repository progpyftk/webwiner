@ Start - deleted the database - starting from scratch

1. Scrap all the website wines - www.wine.com.br - ok

2. Add these products to the postgres database, with all fields treated

3. Add the products to the sql table price history, in order to follow their changes

4. Make another complete scrap in order to add new products and update the existing ones

5. Get all the global_id in the database


# TO DO

# create a model to read the global_id and its prices over the time ( what to use? arrays? hash?)

# create a new class, named wine, in which will be able to print wine graph, it will be mixed in with database module, then it can read from the db

#

#

# add the field "available" to the wine objects. In order to update and check if the store has it on stock
